/** \file
 * \brief Manager of control files.
 *
 * This file includes the implementation of the control file manager.
 *
 * A control file is a specialized field object that understands package
 * information such as the Package field with the name of the package,
 * the Architecture field, the Description field, etc.
 *
 * The objects are capable to manage all the fields that are well defined
 * It also knows how to read control files and write fields to control
 * files (useful just to canonicalize your control files.)

 * \brief Handle a control file.

 * \brief The binary control file.
 *
 * This class handles a binary control file. This means a control file
 * read from a binary Debian package. Some fields are not checked as
 * harshly in such files because it is less important when handling
 * binary packages.
 */


/** \class status_control_file
 * \brief The status control file.
 *
 * This class handles status control files which do not have the same list
 * of mandatory fields as a regular control file.
 *
 * Also, because the system only expects tools such as wpkg to modify this
 * file via the library, the fields are not checked on read. They are
 * expected to be valid.

 * \brief The source control file.
 *
 * When reading a control file from a source project, this class is used
 * to handle the fields of that file.
 *
 * The source control file knows about simple control files and
 * control.info files. Both can be handled and in both cases all the
 * mandatory fields are not expected to be defined in the file. This
 * is because many of the fields are defined from the changelog
 * information. For example, the changelog defines the Version field
 * and therefore in a source control file the Version is not
 * mandatory. If not present it gets created from the changelog file.
 */


/** \class file_item
 * \brief A helper class used to parse and manage lists of files.
 *
 * The control file format accepts fields such as the Files field which
 * represent lists of files. We support some 5 different formats for
 * those lists. This class helps in parsing these fields and
 * transforming the content of the fields in lists of meta data
 * that can be used by other classes.
 */


/** \class file_list_t
 * \brief A list of file_item.
 *
 * This class is a vector of file_item. It is not just a typedef because
 * it includes a to_string() function used to transform the list of
 * files \em back in a field content (note: \em back is in italic because
 * it can also be used to transform lists created in memory to a new
 * field.)
 *
 * The name of the file_list_t class is the name of the field that was
 * parsed to obtain this information.
 */


/** \class standards_version
 * \brief The standards version parser.
 *
 * This class validates a standards version meaning the version of
 * the documentation used to create the list of control fields
 * and other parts of the package.
 *
 * At this point the version is verified and it has to be 3 or 4
 * numbers separated by periods such as 2.0.3 or 2.0.4.7. The version
 * number must be at least 2.0.0.0 to be considered valid. When the
 * forth number is not defined, it is considered to be zero.

/** \class control_file::control_file_state_t
 * \brief The basic state trait for a control file.
 *
 * This is the basic trait used for control files. It defines the

 * default control files do not allow transformation. Only the control
 * files read while building a new package are allowed to transform
 * variables.

 * certain fields and forbids others.
 */


/** \class control_file::contents_control_file_state_t
 * \brief Content based state trait.
 *
 * This class defines the trait to define a contents control file. This is
 * generally not checking as much as the other traits. This is because
 * when reading a control file for its contents, it is too late to tell
 * the user that everything is wrong/invalid. Plus, you may want to check
 * the contents of an older control file which would become incompatible
 * if this trait was too strict.
 */


/** \class control_file::control_field_factory_t
 * \brief Factory used to create control file fields.
 *
 * This class supports a list of control fields that can be created while
 * loading a control file. All the fields that this factory supports are
 * those defined in the wpkg_control_field.cpp file.
 *
 * A field defined in the wpkg_control_field.cpp file is automatically
 * added to the list that this class maintains so it can create those
 * fields.
 *
 * If the input control file has a field that is not defined in the
 * wpkg_control_field.cpp file, then the default field constructor is
 * used and this means no checks are applied to the field.
 */


/** \class control_file::control_field_t
 * \brief Overload of the basic field class of the wpkg_field class.
 *
 * This class is used to create all the fields in a control file. The
 * constructor ensures that the field gets registered so that way it
 * can be created with the control_field_factory_t function.
 *
 * The class also has a set of functions that are useful to verify
 * fields that are of a generic type.
 */


/** \class control_file::dependency_field_t
 * \brief The base field type for all dependency fields.
 *
 * There are many dependency fields so we have a base specialization
 * for them. This class defines an additional verification function
 * named verify_value() which ensures that the field is a valid
 * list of dependencies.
 *
 * Since the class is derived from the control_file::control_field_t class,
 * it also has access to all the other verification functions.

 * of this structure that end with a null entry (i.e. the f_term and
 * f_help fields are set to NULL.)
 *
 * The terms are expected to be used in certain fields. Lists of terms
 * represent valid values for those fields. For example, the Property
 * field is limited to only very small set of words:
 *
 * \li required
 * \li important
 * \li standard
 * \li optional
 * \li extra
 *
 * This structure is used to valid such fields and the help is there
 * to allow tools such as wpkg to display the help information.

 * for validity.

/** \brief Create a source control file.
 *
 * Source control files are heavily checked for their contents. However,
 * contrary to a binary control file, the mandatory fields are not required
 * to exist in the control file because we can gather that information from
 * other files. For example, the changelog defines the package name, version,
 * urgency, maintainer, version date, and change logs (obviously!)
 *
 * In most cases, the Architecture field is not defined. This is because we
 * expect that it will be possible to recompile the project on any
 * architecture. In this case, the control file is assigned a default
 * value:
 *
 * \code
 * Architecture: $(architecture())
 * \endcode
 *
 * If the project only compiles on one Architecture, then it should be
 * specified. If one of the component is the same on all architectures
 * (i.e. documentation) then the Architecture can be set to \b all:
 *
 * \code
 * Sub-Packages: runtime*, documentation
 * ...
 * Architecture/documentation: all
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note that under MS-Windows we generally do not place the files under
 * a /usr sub-directory so even the documentation would have to be
 * regenerated.
