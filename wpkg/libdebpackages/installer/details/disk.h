/** \brief The disk class to manage installation sizes.
 *
 * This class handles disk metadeta when computing the installation
 * sizes of a package (i.e. evaluating whether the destination disk
 * is large enough to accept the packages that are about to be
 * installed on it.)
 *
 * This class has a function called match() which detects whether
 * a given filename represents a file to be installed on that disk.
 *
 * \note
 * At this time this functionality is not available at all on any system
 * because there are problems on all except Linux. The current Microsoft
 * Windows implementation does not properly detect what a letter drive
 * really represents and as such would revert to C:\\ and often generate
 * and error when the other drive(s) where the packages would really
 * be installed were more than large enough.

 * the list of disks which one is a match. Once the match was found, it
