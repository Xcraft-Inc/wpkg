/** \file
 * \brief Implementation of the fields as found in the Internet Message format.
 *
 * This base class is used to implement the wpkg_control and wpkg_copyright
 * formats that are necessary to read control and copyright files in a Debian
 * package.
 *
 * This base class is capable of reach the fields as expected by the Debian
 * control file specifications. This includes the name of the fields, an
 * optional component separated by a slash (/) from the name, and the value
 * of the fields. The value may be written on one line or multiple lines
 * when the following lines start with one or more spaces. It also supports
 * empty lines.
 *
 * One part in a control file cannot include the same field more than once.
 * However, one control file can include multiple parts and each part can
 * include the same field (i.e. each part can have its own version of a
 * field.) In most cases this is used to overwrite the default that was
 * found in the first part read from the source. But each format has its
 * own specification in that regard.
 *
 * \note
 * This format is the same as the one used by the Internet Message protocol
 * (i.e. emails.)

/** \class wpkg_field_exception
 * \brief The base exception of the wpkg_field classes.
 *
 * This exception class is used as the base exception for all the other

/** \class wpkg_field_exception_invalid
 * \brief Something is invalid.

 * in most cases the exception is raised because the input data is invalid.
 */


/** \class wpkg_field_exception_cyclic
 * \brief A variable reference is cyclic as in: it references itself.
 *
 * When reading a control file that includes variables, the loader reads
 * the data as is. However, once we retrieve that data, the variables
 * and expressions get processes. When that happens, a variable will
 * eventually itself include variable references and expressions. These
 * are themselves processed. This goes as deep as required, although a
 * warning is displayed after 1,000 layers. However, if any one layer
 * references a variable that we are currently computing, then it is
 * viewed as being cyclic. For example, you could write something like
 * this in a control file:
 *
 * \code
 * Description: ${short_description}
 * short_description=This is the short description of ${project_name}.
 * project_name=complex ${name_v3}
 * name_v3=info about ${last_variable} and more
 * last_variable=${short_description}
 * \endcode
 *
 * As we can see, last_variable makes a reference to short_description
 * which itself makes reference to last_variable through project_name
 * and name_v3. This is considered cyclic as it would cycle forever
 * were we to not detect this case (note that was fixed since 0.9.0.
 * It would cycle in older versions.)
 */


/** \class wpkg_field_exception_undefined
 * \brief Something you are trying to access is undefined.
 *
 * This exception is raised whenever something being accessed does not
 * exist or when creating a new field_file object and the pointer to
 * the state is NULL.
 *
 * Note that when trying to retrieve a field that may not exist, you
 * first should check whether it is defined with the field_is_defined()
 * function.

/** \class field_file
 * \brief Base class to read, write, and manage fields.

 * <name>: <value>
 * \endcode
 *
 * The format supports for the value to be written on multiple lines and
 * for the field name to include a sub-package name:
 *
 * \code
 * Description/wpkg: Short Description here
 *  Long Description There
 * \endcode
 *
 * At this time, the control and control.info file formats and the
 * copyright file format make use of the field_file base class.
 */


/** \class field_file::field_t
 * \brief When retrieving a field, you get this class.
 *
 * This class handles one field. It knows about the field name, sub-package
 * specification, the raw value and can read the transformed value.
 *
 * Because it is particularly useful for errors, each field also gets the
 * name of the file from which it was read and the line on which it was
 * found.
 */


/** \class field_file::field_factory_t
 * \brief When reading a field file, we use a factory to create fields.
 *
 * This class is used to create all the fields read from the input file.
 * The create() function is called with the name of the file from which
 * the field was read, the name of the field and the value. Based on
 * that information, the factor must be capable of creating a new field.
 *
 * Note that in most cases only the name of the field is used to determine
 * the field class to use and the value is passed to that object as it
 * gets created. This process is important because the set_value() function
 * strongly checks the validity of the new value whereas the constructor
 * does not, letting go some errors from older control files in some
 * circumstances.
 */


/** \class field_file::field_file_state_t
 * \brief The state or trait of the field_file.
 *
 * This class is the base class used to define a trait while reading the
 * field_file data from an input file. The state defines a set of functions
 * that may return true or false and depending on the result change the
 * behavior of the reader.

 * being the same as the variables found in the field_file. See

 * done the fields are accessible using the get_field() and get_field_list()
 * functions. The existence of a field can be checked with the
 * field_is_defined() function.
 *
 * The fields found in the file are not checked in any way by this
 * function. The class can be derived in order to have the fields
 * checked since the read function is virtual and can thus be re-defined
 * in the new class.
 *
 * The file format is the same as the Debian control file. This is
 * very similar to an email header or a pkgconfig file (.pc). The file
 * content must match or errors will occur.
 *
 * A field is defined as a name followed by a colon and then a value on
 * one or more lines. When defined on multiple lines, the next line must
 * start with a white character (a space or tab character.) The field
 * names are case insensitive, although the function keeps the case found
 * in the input file so it can write it back out with the same case.
 *
 * Field names are limited to letters, digits, and the plus (+), minus (-),
 * period (.), and underscore (_) characters. We also support the special
 * syntax of the .info format which accepts sub-package names after a
 * slash character. Only one sub-package name can appear in a field name.
 *
 * \code
 * Description/debug: The debug version of this package is special.
 * \endcode
 *
 * The name of a field must start with a letter or the underscore character.
 * Any other character is not considered valid as the first character.
 * (Note that Debian does not forbid digits as first characters, but that
 * is not compliant with emails and .pc files. Plus at this point there
 * are no fields that start with a digit and none should be created if
 * that matter.)
 *
 * \note
 * The function always accepts variables. If the format you are reading
 * should not support such, then check how many variables were found and
 * if not zero generate an error.
 *
 * \return true if the read() function succeeded, false if errors were found.

/** \brief Replace variables understood by the low level wpkg_field object.
 *
 * This function transforms variables using the low level wpkg_field object
 * known variables.
 *
 * At this point, the variables known by the field_file implementation
 * are:
 *
 * \li ${Newline} -- replace with "\n"
 * \li ${Space} -- replace with " "
 * \li ${Tab} -- replace with "\t"
 * \li ${wpkg:Upstream-Version} -- the version of this instance of wpkg
 * \li ${wpkg:Version} -- the version of this instance of wpkg
 * \li ${F:\<field>} -- the contents of the named \<field> which will itself be transformed
 * \li ${V:\<variable>} -- the contents of the named \<variable> which will itself be transformed
 *
 * If the named variable is not known, then a warning is generated. In case
 * of the ${F:\<field name>}, if the named field is not known, then a warning
 * is also generated. The result of the function when accessing an undefined
 * value is the empty string ("").
 *
 * Derived classes can redefine this function to support additional
 * variables. In that case, the redefined function needs to check
 * for its variables (i.e. higher priority) and then return by calling
 * this function:
 *
 * \code
 * std::string my_field_file::replace_variable(const field_t *field, const case_insensitive::case_insensitive_string& name) const
 * {
 *     if(name == "Arch")
 *     {
 *         return "in ruins";
 *     }
 *     return field_file::replace_variable(field, name);
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note
 * Variable names are case insensitive, so ${Newline} is equivalent to
 * ${NEWLINE}. Similarly references to fields or field_file variables
 * (entries defined with the colon (:) or the equal (=) characters by
 * the read() function) are also case insensitive. For example, the
 * following few groups are equivalent:
 *
 * \code
 * ${NewLine}
 * ${Newline}
 * ${NEWLINE}
 *
 * ${F:Package}
 * ${f:package}
 * ${F:PACKAGE}
 *
 * ${V:ROOT_TREE}
 * ${v:root_tree}
 * \endcode
 *
 * \param[in] field  The field being transformed with details such as the
 *                   source filename and line number.
 * \param[in] name  The name of the variable to load.
 *
 * \return The contents of the variable or the empty string ("").

/** \brief Transform a field value with variables and expressions.

 *
 * This function is called whenever you use the get_field() function to
 * read a field. Note that variables (i.e. ROOT_TREE=/this/root/dir)
 * found in control files are not transformed in this way.
 *
 * Additional information about the debian capability can be found using

 * \code
 * man deb-substvars
 * \endcode
 *
 * \todo
 * The support for a lone $ is fairly poor at this time. It is not unlikely
 * that it won't work right in some cases. A lone $ is expected to be
 * written as "${}". However, because of the repetitive parsing of the
 * result for further transformations we may end up transforming a lone
 * $ in an unexpected way.
 *
 * \exception wpkg_field_exception_invalid
 * wpkg_field_exception_invalid is raised if the transformation
 * includes an empty expression such as: "$()", or when a variable
 * or an expression reference is missing the closing bracket or
 * parenthesis as in "${ThisVariable" or "$(3 * (7 + 5)".

 * create_field() function. In effect this is a way to create a field of
 * any type acceptable in the field_file you are managing.
 *
 * Note that the name is passed as a case insensitive string. This makes
 * it easy to test the string since in most cases the case is not
 * significant. However, if you need to test case sensitively, you can
 * simply copy the name in an std::string first.
 *
 * Not only will the function create the field, it will also verify that
 * the value is valid for that field. If not valid, then the function
 * throws an error.
 *
 * \note
 * Since this is a factory it has to allocate the field which is a little
 * different from what we had before, but does not make such a difference.
 * We return a shared pointer so you can copy the shared pointer around
 * and once done you can simply reset() the pointer.
 *
 * \param[in] name  The name of the field.
 * \param[in] value  The value of the field, the function does an
