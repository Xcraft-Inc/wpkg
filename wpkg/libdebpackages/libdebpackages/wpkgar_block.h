/** \file
 * \brief The wpkg archive file for indexes.
 *
 * When installing a package with wpkg, it creates an index using the wpkg
 * archive format which is the list of files without any data (think of it
 * as a tarball on which you can run `tar tvf archive` but cannot
 * `tar xf archive`).
 *
 * The header defined in this file is the header used to define each file.
 * Although in most cases we use exactly one block per file, when a file
 * has a name that does not fit in the block header (i.e. 300 UTF-8
 * bytes) then additional blocks are used to define the full filename.
 * This also applies to symbolic links.
 *
 * The size of one block is exactly 1Kb.
