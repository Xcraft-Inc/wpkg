/** \class wpkgar_backup
 * \brief The backup class to keep track of backed up files.
 *
 * The backup class implements functions useful to backup (copy) files
 * from their current location to a backup location (the temporary folder).
 * A backup object destructor ensures that the backed up files are restored
 * unless the process marked the backup as successful.
 *
 * The backup can be used to copy existing files or mark that the file
 * did not exit in the first place (i.e. if a restore occurs, the new file
 * gets deleted.)
 *
 * \todo
 * The current backup process does not save any of the meta data of files
 * which means that the restore feature cannot actually properly restore
 * everything the way it was.
 */

 *
 * This function initializes a backup object so a process can update files
 * safely (i.e. if an error occurs while updating, the backup can restore
 * the state from before the update started.)

 *
 * This function informs the backup object that we are about to replace

 * a copy by reading the whole file in memory and then saving that back
 * to disk.
 *
 * The backup function also understands that when the file does not
 * exist yet, the \em backup means marking that the new file will need
 * to be deleted on a restore.
 *
 * However, if the file cannot be backed up, because of an I/O error or
 * because of permissions or similar error, then the backup function
 * returns false.
 *
 * Note that if you try to backup the same file twice, the function returns
 * false as if the second backup failed. This is used as a safeguard.
 *
 * \return true if the file gets backed up.
